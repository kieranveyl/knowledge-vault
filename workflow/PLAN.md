## Dependency Management Strategy

### Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Database Stability** → All subsequent development
2. **Search Infrastructure** → User value and testing
3. **Indexing Pipeline** → Content visibility
4. **Session Management** → User experience continuity

### Parallel Development Opportunities

- **Observability implementation** can proceed alongside core features
- **Configuration management** can be developed independently
- **Advanced tokenization** can be implemented after basic search works
- **Export/snapshot features** can be developed in parallel with optimization

### Risk Mitigation Tactics

- **Database issues**: Fix in Phase 1 before building dependent features
- **Search performance**: Start with functional implementation, optimize later
- **Integration complexity**: Implement comprehensive testing at each phase
- **Scope creep**: Stick to MVP definition, defer nice-to-have features

- **Effect library learning curve**: Invest in team training and documentation
- **Database integration issues**: Prioritize fixing in Phase 1

### Project Risks

- **Scope creep**: Maintain strict MVP definition, defer non-critical features
- **Performance unknowns**: Establish benchmarking early and continuously
- **Integration complexity**: Build comprehensive testing at each phase
- **Timeline pressure**: Focus on critical path, parallelize where possible

### Business Risks

- **User value realization**: Prioritize search functionality for early validation
- **Feature completeness**: Balance MVP delivery with long-term compliance
- **System reliability**: Invest in monitoring and error recovery early
- **Scalability concerns**: Validate performance with realistic data sets

## Conclusion

This development plan provides a structured path from the current 45% implementation to full spec compliance over 25 weeks. The plan prioritizes:

1. **Foundation stability** (database integration) as prerequisite for all development
2. **Core user value** (search functionality) for early validation and testing
3. **Production readiness** (performance, monitoring, reliability) for deployment
4. **Full compliance** (complete feature set) for long-term success

The roadmap balances aggressive timeline targets with realistic technical challenges, providing clear success criteria and risk mitigation strategies at each phase. Regular validation and testing ensure early detection of issues and course correction opportunities.

**Key Success Factors:**

- Fix database integration issues immediately
- Implement basic search capability quickly for end-to-end testing
- Maintain focus on critical path while building necessary infrastructure
- Invest in performance measurement and optimization throughout development

With disciplined execution of this plan, the Knowledge Repository project can deliver a functional MVP in 12 weeks and achieve full spec compliance in 25 weeks.
