curl "http://localhost:3001/search?q=knowledge%20management"

# Search specific collections
curl "http://localhost:3001/search?q=performance&collections=col_123,col_456"

# Paginated search
curl "http://localhost:3001/search?q=research&page=0&page_size=10"

# Publish content to make it searchable
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/publish \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"note_id":"note_123","collections":["col_456"],"label":"major","client_token":"pub_123"}'

# Create collections
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/collections \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"My Collection","description":"Collection description"}'

# Save drafts
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/drafts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

### Version Control

```bash
bun scripts/version-history.ts
```

Shows version evolution, rollback functionality, audit trails.

### Complete API Validation

```bash
bun scripts/test-complete-api.ts
```

Tests all API endpoints and SPEC compliance.

## Database Management

### Start API Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Starts server on http://localhost:3001 with full search capabilities.

## Production API Endpoints

### Health Monitoring

- `GET /healthz` - Basic health check
- `GET /health` - Detailed health status

### Collection Management

- `POST /collections` - Create collection
- `GET /collections` - List collections
- `GET /collections/:id` - Get specific collection

### Draft Operations

- `POST /drafts` - Save draft content
- `GET /drafts/:note_id` - Retrieve draft

### Publication System

- `POST /publish` - Publish draft with indexing
- `POST /rollback` - Rollback to previous version
- `GET /notes/:id/versions` - Version history

### Search System

- `GET /search` - Full-text search with answer composition
    - Query params: `q`, `collections`, `page`, `page_size`
    - Returns: Results with citations and extractive answers

## Search Features

### Collection Scoping

```bash
# Search in specific collections
curl "http://localhost:3001/search?q=research&collections=col_123,col_456"
```

### Answer Composition

- Fully extractive answers from published content

- Real-time indexing after publication

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues

```bash
# Check if database is running
make db-status

# Restart database
make db-stop
make db-start

# Complete reset
make db-reset
```

### Search Problems

```bash
# Test search system
bun scripts/test-search.ts

# Check indexing pipeline
bun scripts/test-complete-api.ts

# Verify content is published
make db-shell
# SELECT * FROM publications;
```

### API Issues

```bash
# Test all endpoints
bun scripts/test-complete-api.ts

# Check specific errors
bun test src/tests/integration.api.test.ts

# Start development server
bun run dev
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development

```bash
make db-start                    # Start database
bun scripts/test-complete-api.ts # Verify system works
# ... development work ...
bun test                         # Run all tests
```

### Search Development

```bash
make db-reset                    # Fresh database
bun scripts/test-search.ts       # Test search system
bun scripts/test-complete-api.ts # Full integration test
```
