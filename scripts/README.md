## SPEC Compliance Matrix

| SPEC Section               | Script                                     | Implementation Status | Key Features                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Section 1: System Overview | `demo-workflow.ts`                         | [OK] Complete         | Draft-by-default, version preservation    |
| Section 2: Ontology        | `create-draft.ts`, `manage-collections.ts` | [OK] Complete         | Core entities, relationships, identifiers |
| Section 3: Data Model      | `publish-note.ts`                          | [OK] Complete         | Schema implementation, content hashing    |
| Section 4: Interfaces      | All scripts                                | [TARGET] Partial      | Editorâ†”Store complete, Search pending    |
| Section 5: Behavior        | `version-history.ts`, `publish-note.ts`    | [OK] Complete         | Two-phase publish, rollback workflow      |

## Performance Targets

The scripts demonstrate adherence to SPEC performance requirements:

- **Search Latency**: P50 â‰¤ 200ms, P95 â‰¤ 500ms (target defined, measurement pending)
- **Publishâ†’Searchable**: P50 â‰¤ 5s, P95 â‰¤ 10s (workflow implemented, indexing pending)
- **Version Creation**: Sub-second for typical content (achieved)

## Expected Output

Each script provides:

1. **Step-by-step execution** with clear progress indicators
2. **SPEC compliance verification** against requirements
3. **Technical validation** of implementation details
4. **Performance metrics** where applicable
5. **Next steps guidance** for continued development

## Error Handling

Scripts include comprehensive error handling:

- Database connection validation
- Migration status checking
- Proper cleanup on failure
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting steps

## Development Workflow

### For Testing Individual Components

```bash
# Test draft functionality
bun scripts/create-draft.ts

# Test collection management
bun scripts/manage-collections.ts

# Test publication workflow
bun scripts/publish-note.ts
```

### For System Integration Testing

```bash
# Complete end-to-end validation
bun scripts/demo-workflow.ts
```

### For Database Management

```bash
# Apply migrations
bun scripts/migrate.ts

# Reset database (if needed)
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
bun scripts/migrate.ts
```

## Implementation Status

### [OK] Fully Implemented

- Draft creation and management
- Collection operations
- Publication workflow
- Version control and rollback
- Database integration
- API error handling

### [TARGET] Partially Implemented

- Search functionality (interface defined, implementation pending)
- Indexing pipeline (architecture ready, implementation pending)
- Performance monitoring (targets defined, measurement pending)

### [ERR] Not Yet Implemented

- Session management and replay
- Snapshot and export functionality
- Real-time search indexing
- Answer composition with citations

## Next Phase Development

These scripts provide the foundation for Phase 2 development:

1. **Search Implementation**: Use `search-notes.ts` as specification for Orama adapter
2. **Indexing Pipeline**: Implement visibility â†’ corpus â†’ index workflow
3. **Performance Optimization**: Add measurement and optimization based on SPEC targets
4. **Session Management**: Extend scripts to include session tracking and replay

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    # Wait for PostgreSQL to be ready
    bun scripts/migrate.ts
    ```

2. **Migration Errors**

    ```bash
    # Check database logs
    docker-compose logs postgres

    # Reset if needed
    docker-compose down
    docker volume rm knowledge-repository_postgres_data
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. **Import/Module Errors**
    ```bash
    bun install  # Reinstall dependencies
    ```

### Script-Specific Issues

- **create-draft.ts**: Ensure collections exist (run `manage-collections.ts` first)
- **publish-note.ts**: Requires existing collections for publication
- **search-notes.ts**: Shows expected behavior (search implementation pending)
- **demo-workflow.ts**: Requires clean database state for full execution

**Note**: These scripts are designed to be both educational and functional, providing clear examples of how to use the Knowledge Repository system while validating SPEC compliance at every step.
